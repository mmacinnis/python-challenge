This script analyses the data (a csv file in subfolder 'resources') to produce the following results: 

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

It then displays to terminal and writes to a text file, found in the 'analysis' subdirectory.

The code can be found in main.py in the root directory.

I'm aware of the "error" thrown by the compiler. I'd argue this is not an error but a warning that the method used is about to deprecated, and this is hardly a concern for an assignment like this. The code works as request and returns the required outputs.
